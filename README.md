ðŸ¥‹ Sumo Robot (Dual Arduino - Sensor & Motor Control)
This project is a Sumo Robot built using two Arduino boards that communicate over UART. One Arduino handles sensor input and decision-making, while the other controls the motors and movement based on received commands. The robot is designed to detect opponents and avoid falling off the edge of the arena.

ðŸ“¦ System Overview
Sensor Arduino: Detects opponents using an ultrasonic sensor and arena edges using line sensors. It makes decisions and sends commands to the Motor Arduino.

Motor Arduino: Receives commands from the Sensor Arduino and controls the motors using an L293D H-bridge.

ðŸ”Œ Hardware Components
Microcontrollers
2 Ã— Arduino Uno (or compatible)

Sensors
1 Ã— Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)

3 Ã— Infrared line sensors (left, center, right)

Actuators & Power
2 or 4 DC motors

1 Ã— L293D Motor Driver

Power switch (KCD1)

Power source (battery pack)

ðŸ”„ UART Communication Protocol
The Sensor Arduino sends single-character commands over Serial to the Motor Arduino. Each command represents a specific movement:

Command	Action
F	Move Forward
B	Move Backward
L	Rotate Left
R	Rotate Right
S	Stop
A	Ram Attack (Fast Fwd)

ðŸ§  Behavior Logic (Sensor Arduino)
Line Detection:

If a line is detected (edge of arena), the robot backs away and rotates to stay inside.

Opponent Detection:

If the opponent is within range, the robot charges forward (ram attack).

If no opponent is detected, the robot rotates left/right alternately to search.

Command Resending:

Commands are periodically resent to ensure consistent motor behavior.

ðŸ”§ How to Use
Upload the Sensor Code to one Arduino.

Upload the Motor Code to the second Arduino.

Connect Serial (TX/RX) between the two boards (cross-wired: TX â†’ RX and RX â†’ TX).

Wire Sensors and Motors properly to each Arduino.

Power on using the KCD1 switch and place the robot in the arena.

ðŸ“‚ Code Structure
sensor_arduino.ino â€“ Main logic for decision-making and UART communication.

motor_arduino.ino â€“ Handles motor control based on commands.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
Ensure both Arduinos use the same baud rate.

TX and RX lines must be cross-connected (TX to RX).

Add capacitors and proper grounding for stable performance.

Avoid using Serial Monitor while using UART for inter-Arduino communication.

ðŸ¤– Future Improvements
Add a strategy mode switch (aggressive vs defensive).

Use PID control for precise motor handling.

Implement EEPROM or remote control override for behavior switching.# sumoo
